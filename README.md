# without_extention_FILE_opener_light
Light version of Michael Martin bat-file. 
This scrypt program setup association of files without extention to open with notepad. 
Program is so light, so it's probably PD-trivial. 
Windows only.

Working good on Windows 7 x64. Association is still works OK even after Windows restart.
