# without_extension_FILE_opener_light
Light version of Michael Martin bat-file. 
This script program setup association of files without extension to open with notepad. 
Program is so light, so it's probably PD-trivial. 
Windows only.

Working good on Windows 7 x64. Association is still works OK even after Windows restart.
